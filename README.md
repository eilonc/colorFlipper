Project: 
Colors Flipper

Description:
Dynamic web page that will change the background's color each time user will click the "click me" button, and will display its key on the screen.

There are 3 webpages:
1. index.html -- will generate a color out of bank of predefined colors.
2. hex.html -- will generate a random color-key out of mashing an array contains the 0-9 numbers & A-F letters.
3. random.html -- will generate a random color-key using only random numbers // VERY INTERESTING SOLUTION, I WILL BE GLAD TO TAKE ANY NOTES :) // 

Thanks
